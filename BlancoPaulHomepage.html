<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
	<p>To-do lists can help individuals and teams be more productive, reduce stress and overwhelm, and improve their overall sense of accomplishment. They can also help to ensure that important tasks are not forgotten or overlooked, and that deadlines are met. In addition, to-do lists can be used to improve communication and collaboration within teams and organizations. By sharing to-do lists, team members can ensure that everyone is on the same page, and can work together to prioritize tasks and achieve common goals. Overall, the purpose of a to-do list is to provide a simple and effective tool for managing tasks, staying organized, and achieving success in personal and professional life.</p>
