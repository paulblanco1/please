<center><h1>APP SAFETY</h1></center>
<br>To-do list apps can be a helpful tool for staying organized and productive. However, there are some general safety precautions you should take to ensure your personal information is secure and to minimize the risk of data loss or theft. Here are some tips:</br>
<br>1.	Use a secure password: Choose a strong password for your to-do list app and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts. Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong passwords.</br>
<br>2.	Enable two-factor authentication: Many to-do list apps offer two-factor authentication as an added security measure. This requires you to enter a code sent to your phone or email in addition to your password, making it harder for hackers to access your account.</br>
<br>3.	Keep your app up-to-date: Make sure you have the latest version of your to-do list app installed, as updates often include security fixes and patches.</br>
<br>4.	Be cautious with public Wi-Fi: Avoid using public Wi-Fi when accessing your to-do list app, as these networks can be easily compromised by hackers. If you must use public Wi-Fi, consider using a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your internet traffic.</br>
<br>5.	Backup your data: Regularly backup your to-do list data to ensure that you don't lose important information in the event of a device failure or data breach.</br>
<br>6.	Read app permissions carefully: Be cautious when granting app permissions, as some apps may request access to sensitive information such as your contacts or location. Only grant permissions that are necessary for the app to function properly.</br>
