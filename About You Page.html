<h1>WORK HISTORY</h1>
<p>In my formative years, I undertook various employment opportunities, beginning with a local paper route in the serene town of Riverton, Wyoming. The role entailed walking across the town to deliver newspapers promptly while ensuring the product remained in pristine condition. Subsequently, I transitioned to a cashier position at Walmart, where my service and work ethics earned me the promotion to the position of Customer Service Manager within a year. Following my departure from Walmart, I took up a post as a Corrections Officer at the Wyoming State Prison, an experience that led me to my current role as an Air and Missile Defense Team Leader. My tenure in this position introduced me to fundamental coding skills, which were pivotal in keeping one of our weapon systems operational and, subsequently, sparked my pursuit of an education in computer science.</p>
